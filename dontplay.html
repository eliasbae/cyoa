  <h3>"BLOAW."</center></h3></div>
All of a sudden you stop what you're doing and hear the terrifying noise of a massive airhorn fill the air! All of a sudden the horrid cacophony of trap snares combined with Hans Zimmer-esque piano samples fills your ears. You're forced to cover your ears out of protest, but you are unable to prevent the massive dirge filling your poor ears. Soon enough, you feel your soul sap from you yet again, your hands move without any sort of input from your own body. Before your mouth edges itself open. Yelling out the final words you hear before you black out. "PULL OUT THE SEVEN, PULL OUT THE RIIIIIDE."<br><br>
