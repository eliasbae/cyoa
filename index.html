	<p>The lone ranger roams around the outskirts of the rapidly shifting surroundings. Tumbleweeds surround the area around him, the bright sunshine glares down on his skin. Still, he continues to stand, uncaring of any odd looks that he might get at him in this state. After staring at him for a few seconds, you suddenly find everything fade to black. You pass out for who knows how long, and then awaken in a form that is decisively, not yours. You raise your right hand, and you observe that it is sinewy, black and hardened with time. A golden chain adorns your chest, your teeth have been replaced with a multicolored set of bronzed metals. After observing your body for a minute straight or so, you determine that you've wasted enough time. What do you do?</p>
