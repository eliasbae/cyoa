  <h3>">Stare at the sun."</h3>


  <p>You allow the subtle influence of the man who's body you inhabited to take over and stare into the sun. For some odd reason, it no longer hurts you, matter of fact you find yourself inspired by the light. Without the glaring flares blinding you, you can now observe the true beauty of such a wonderful work of human creation.

  Though, without the guise of rays you're able to slowly pick apart the details of the sun. Though something seems a bit off. You view the sun closer.

  Wait
  <br><br>
  No.
